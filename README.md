### Contributing
Don't hesitate to e-mail or PM me with requests, queries and suggestions. You can also clone this repo and submit PRs.

If you would like to work on the frontend design, to make something more visually appealing, or develop an alternative frontend for mobile using React Native, please get in touch!

### Future development
The priority is to add functionality to allow users to filter the displayed blog posts by any relevant field (language, for example). Other important developments concern accessibility and internationalization.

It would also be nice to build a WordPress plugin to allow bloggers to automatically add their new posts to the site!
